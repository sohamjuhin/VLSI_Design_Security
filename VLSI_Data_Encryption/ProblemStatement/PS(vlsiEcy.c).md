Creating a C programming problem for VLSI (Very Large-Scale Integration) data encryption is a complex task that involves multiple steps and considerations. Here's a simplified example of a C programming problem related to VLSI data encryption:

**Problem Statement: VLSI Data Encryption**

You are tasked with designing a basic data encryption system for a VLSI chip. The chip receives a stream of data as input and needs to encrypt it using a simple XOR-based encryption algorithm.

Your goal is to write a C program that performs the following tasks:

1. Read a string of characters from the user as plaintext.
2. Generate a random encryption key of the same length as the input plaintext.
3. Encrypt the plaintext using the XOR operation with the encryption key.
4. Display the encrypted text.

Your program should meet the following requirements:

- The encryption key should be generated using a random number generator.
- Use a function to perform the XOR encryption.
- Ensure the program can handle strings of varying lengths.

**Example:**

Input:
```
Enter plaintext: HelloWorld
```

Output:
```
Encryption key: 0x1A3B4C5D
Encrypted text: 0x1E293E0F
```

**Hints:**

1. You can use the `rand()` function from the `<stdlib.h>` library to generate random numbers for the encryption key.
2. Remember to seed the random number generator using `srand()` to get different random keys each time you run the program.
3. Use bitwise XOR (`^`) to perform the encryption.

**Constraints:**

- The input plaintext will contain only printable ASCII characters.
- The length of the plaintext will not exceed 100 characters.

**Additional Challenge (Optional):**

Implement a decryption function to reverse the encryption and recover the original plaintext. Make sure it works correctly.

This problem provides a simplified introduction to encryption algorithms and how they can be implemented in the context of VLSI data processing. Depending on the complexity and scope of your VLSI project, you might need to explore more advanced encryption techniques and integrate them into your design.
